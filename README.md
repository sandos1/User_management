# User_management



building a simple User Management web application that manages a collection of users with the basic feature: list, insert, update, delete
(or CURD operations - Create, Update, Read and Delete).

I will develop below simple basic features in our User Management web application:
- Create a User
- Update a User
- Delete a User
- Retrieve a User
- List of all Users
